# FlaskTen Chatbot README

**Welcome to the  FlaskTen Chatbot repository! This project demonstrates a basic chatbot application designed to integrate with web applications. The chatbot can respond to simple user inputs and can be further trained for more complex interactions.**

## 2. Frameworks and Libraries Used

This project is built using the following frameworks and libraries:

- **Flask** : A lightweight WSGI web application framework to handle the backend and serve the chatbot through a web interface.
- **JSON** : To structure and manage data exchanged between the client and server.
- **TensorFlow** : For machine learning tasks, allowing the chatbot to understand and process user inputs.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** : To help the chatbot perform natural language processing tasks such as tokenizing, stemming, and understanding text.

## 3. Integration with Web Apps

The chatbot is designed to integrate seamlessly with web applications. Flask acts as the backend, serving an API endpoint that the frontend can interact with. The client sends user inputs to the server, where the chatbot processes the input using TensorFlow and NLTK, and returns a relevant response in JSON format.

### Steps to Integrate:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the Flask server using the command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the chatbot on your browser by visiting `http://localhost:5000`.

### Web App Demo

Below is a demo image showcasing the chatbot's integration with a simple web application:

## 4. Usage

Once the Flask server is running, you can interact with the chatbot by entering text into the web interface. The bot will respond based on the predefined logic set up within the code, and it can be further improved by training it on more diverse datasets.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the chatbot's functionality to fit your needs!
